This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in VBScript: unexpected behavior in conditional statements due to implicit type conversion.  VBScript's loose typing can lead to comparisons yielding unexpected results, especially when mixing string and numeric types. The `bug.vbs` file illustrates the issue, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with explicit type checking.
